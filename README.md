# programming_in_cpp

## Overview
This repo is intended to provide a helpful overview of some of the primary features of C++ as well as the implementation of core programming concepts in C++

Materials in this repo include:
+ a cheat sheet of some of the most important concepts in C++ (with customizable "source files")
+ the implementation of basic data structures (both manually and using the STL)
+ the implementation of widely used algorithms (both manually and using the STL)
+ and the implementation of some of the core concepts of object-oriented programming

These tools should serve as a helpful reference for beginner/intermediate programmers looking to gain a quick understanding of some of the major features of C++, utilize this brief overview as a helpful syntax guide, or have access to an implementation of core programming concepts in the C++ language.
